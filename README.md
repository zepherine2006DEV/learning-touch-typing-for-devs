## General Hints and Tips

DO NOT LOOK AT THE KEYBOARD unless you get lost or need to check a key position.

Always rest your hands on the keyboard in a starting position, with your index fingers resting on the f and j keys, and your other fingers on the adjacent keys. f and j usually have little dimples to help you find them without looking.

Between each character re-center your hands in the starting postion. The aim is not to go quickly but to be accurate to hit keys cleanly.

Some code editors will try and auto-complete some of the characters, so this works best in a simple editor such as Notepad.

I find it useful to vocalise what I'm doing, speaking the name of the character as I press it, to help commit to memory.
